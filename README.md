# CUMovieManagementService

We are going to create 3 projects.
    The first one is going to be the API which is going to provide endpoint to the client
    The second project will be our domain. Our domain is going to store the model class and our interfaces.The domain will be responsible for the business logic of our application.
    Then the third project is going to be data access. This will make the actual read/write requests to the database operation.
